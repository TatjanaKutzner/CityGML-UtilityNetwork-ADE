# CityGML-UtilityNetwork-ADE

The CityGML extension UtilityNetwork ADE defines concepts which allow for modelling different types of networks in the context of 3D city models, such as electricity, freshwater, wastewater, gas or telecommunication networks.

The CityGML UtilityNetwork ADE was originally developed in 2012 at the Insitute for Geodesy and Geoinformation Science, Technische Universität Berlin. Within the OGC, a dedicated work package ([WP 10](https://github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML-3.0/wiki/WP%2010%20Home)) for integrating the UtilityNetwork ADE in CityGML 3.0 exists since 2014. Since 2015, the [Chair of Geoinformatics](http://www.gis.bgu.tum.de/en/home/) at the Technical University of Munich intensely continued with the further development and improvement of the UtilityNetwork ADE. In October 2016, the SIG 3D and the OGC CityGML SWG started to organise joint workshops which aim at discussing and defining a harmonized version of the CityGML UtilityNetwork ADE to be included in CityGML 3.0. Please refer to the [UtilityNetwork ADE workshop wiki](http://en.wiki.utilitynetworks.sig3d.org) for further information on these workshops.

The [CityGML wiki](http://www.citygmlwiki.org/index.php?title=CityGML_UtilityNetworkADE) provides information on the UtilityNetwork ADE as well. The resources available at the CityGML wiki refer to version 0.9.0 of the UtilityNetwork ADE. This version served as basis for the further development of the ADE and for the resources provided on this github repository.
